PRACTICAL 4:

Creating and Managing a Virtual Machine.

a. Set up a virtual machine on a cloud provider or locally (e.g., using VMware or Azure).

b. Configure networking concepts like virtual networks (Vnet), IP addresses, and ports.

c. Deploy the Flask/FastAPI app manually on the VM.


To create and manage a Virtual Machine using VMware, configure networking, and deploy a Flask application manually on Ubuntu.


Software Requirements

• VMware Workstation
• Ubuntu (already installed)
• Python 3
• Flask
• Terminal
• Web Browser


Part (a): Set Up a Virtual Machine Using VMware


Step 1: Open VMware Workstation

1. Launch VMware Workstation.
2. Select your Ubuntu Virtual Machine.
3. Click Power On.


Step 2: Log in to Ubuntu

Enter your Ubuntu username and password.


Step 3: Update Ubuntu

Open the Terminal and run:

sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade -y


Step 4: Verify Python Installation

python3 --version

Example Output:

Python 3.12.3

If Python is not installed:

sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y


Step 5: Install Flask

pip3 install flask

Verify:

pip3 show flask


Result (Part a)

The Ubuntu Virtual Machine is successfully created and configured using VMware.


Part (b): Configure Networking (Virtual Network, IP Address, and Ports)


Step 1: Check the IP Address

Run:

ip addr

or

hostname -I

Example Output:

192.168.43.128

This is your VM's IP address.


Step 2: Understand VMware Network Modes

Network Mode        Description

NAT                 VM shares the host's internet connection (recommended for beginners).

Bridged             VM gets its own IP address on the same network as the host.

Host-only            Communication only between the host and the VM; no internet access.


Recommended:

Use NAT unless your assignment specifies otherwise.


To check or change the mode:

1. Shut down the VM.
2. In VMware, select the VM.
3. Go to VM → Settings → Network Adapter.
4. Choose NAT (or Bridged, if required).


Step 3: Verify Internet Connectivity

ping google.com

If you receive replies, the network is working.


Step 4: Check Listening Ports

sudo ss -tuln

or

netstat -tuln

Typical output:

tcp LISTEN 0 128 0.0.0.0:5000

Port 5000 is commonly used by Flask.


Step 5: Firewall (if enabled)

Allow port 5000:

sudo ufw allow 5000

Check the firewall status:

sudo ufw status


Result (Part b)

The VM network is configured, the IP address is verified, and the required application port is available.


Part (c): Deploy the Flask Application Manually


Step 1: Create a Project Folder

mkdir FlaskApp

cd FlaskApp


Step 2: Create app.py

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello from Ubuntu Virtual Machine!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)


Step 3: Run the Application

python3 app.py

Expected output:

* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000


Step 4: Test the Application

If you're using NAT, first test inside the VM:

Open Firefox in Ubuntu:

http://localhost:5000

Output:

Hello from Ubuntu Virtual Machine!


If you're using Bridged or have configured NAT port forwarding, you can also access it from the host using:

http://<VM_IP_Address>:5000

Example:

http://192.168.43.128:5000


Step 5: Stop the Flask Server

Press:

Ctrl + C
