Introduction to DevOps Tools and Practices
A. Importance of DevOps in Modern Software Development
What is DevOps?
DevOps is a software development approach that combines Development (Dev) and Operations
(Ops) teams to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and deliver software faster and more
reliably.
Importance of DevOps
1. Faster Software Delivery
o Automates building, testing, and deployment processes.
o Reduces time-to-market for new features and updates.
2. Improved Collaboration
o Developers and operations teams work together throughout the software lifecycle.
o Reduces communication gaps and misunderstandings.
3. Higher Software Quality
o Continuous testing identifies bugs early.
o Automated quality checks improve reliability.
4. Increased Deployment Frequency
o Organizations can release updates multiple times a day instead of monthly or
quarterly.
5. Better System Reliability
o Continuous monitoring helps detect and fix issues quickly.
o Infrastructure automation reduces configuration errors.
6. Scalability and Flexibility
o Cloud platforms and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) make scaling easier.

Common DevOps Practices
 Continuous Integration (CI)

 Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
 Monitoring and Logging
 Automated Testing
 Version Control (Git)
 Containerization
Popular DevOps Tools
Category Tools
Version Control Git, GitHub, GitLab
CI/CD Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab

CI

Containers Docker, Podman
Container Orchestration Kubernetes
Configuration
Management Ansible, Puppet, Chef
Monitoring Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios

B. Installation and Exploration of Docker
Why Docker?
Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into
lightweight containers, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.
Installation Steps (Windows)
1. Visit the official Docker website:
o Docker Desktop
2. Download Docker Desktop.
3. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.
4. Restart the system if required.
5. Verify installation:
docker --version
Expected output:
Docker version XX.X.X

Basic Docker Commands
Check Docker Status
docker info
Pull an Image
docker pull nginx
View Images
docker images
Run a Container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
List Running Containers
docker ps
Stop a Container
docker stop &lt;container-id&gt;
Observations
 Docker containers start quickly.
 Applications run consistently across systems.
 Resource usage is lower compared to virtual machines.
 Simplifies deployment and scaling.
Advantages of Docker
 Portability
 Isolation
 Faster deployments
 Reduced infrastructure costs
 Supports microservices architecture
