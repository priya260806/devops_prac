Practical: Setting Up CI/CD with Jenkins


Aim

To set up Jenkins for a Flask/FastAPI application and create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically:

Developer → GitHub → Jenkins → Build → Test → Deploy


Part A — Install Jenkins


1. Install Java

Jenkins requires Java.

You should have JDK 17 or later installed.

Open Command Prompt and run:

java -version

You should see something similar to:

java version "17..."

If Java is working, continue.


2. Install Git

Check Git:

git --version

If you get something like:

git version 2.x.x

Git is installed correctly.


3. Install Jenkins

Download Jenkins from the official Jenkins website:

Jenkins official website

For Windows, download the Windows installer (.msi).

During installation:

1. Run the Jenkins installer.
2. Keep the default installation location.
3. Select LocalSystem if asked about the service account.
4. Select the Java installation.
5. Keep the default Jenkins port, usually:

8080

6. Complete the installation.


4. Open Jenkins

Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:8080

You should see:

Unlock Jenkins

Jenkins will ask for an initial administrator password.

The password is normally stored here:

C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword

Open that file using Notepad and copy the password.

Paste it into Jenkins.


5. Install Jenkins Plugins

Select:

Install suggested plugins

Wait until the installation finishes.

Then create your Jenkins administrator account.

You should finally reach the Jenkins dashboard.


Part B — Create a Simple Flask Application


Create a folder:

flask-jenkins-demo

Open it in VS Code.

Create:

flask-jenkins-demo/
│
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── test_app.py


app.py

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello from Flask CI/CD!"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)


requirements.txt

Flask
pytest


test_app.py

from app import app


def test_home():
    client = app.test_client()
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.data == b"Hello from Flask CI/CD!"


Part C — Test the Application Manually


Open the VS Code terminal.

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv

Activate it:

venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the test:

pytest

You should get:

1 passed

Run Flask:

python app.py

Open:

http://localhost:5000

You should see:

Hello from Flask CI/CD!


Part D — Upload Project to GitHub


Create a new repository on GitHub, for example:

flask-jenkins-demo

Then in your VS Code terminal:

git init

git add .

git commit -m "Initial Flask application"

git branch -M main

git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL

git push -u origin main

After pushing, your GitHub repository should contain:

app.py
requirements.txt
test_app.py


Part E — Create Jenkins Pipeline


Go to:

Jenkins Dashboard
↓
New Item

Enter:

Flask-CI-CD

Select:

Pipeline

Click:

OK


Configure Pipeline

Scroll down to:

Pipeline

Select:

Pipeline script

Enter this Jenkinsfile:

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {

        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main',
                    url: 'YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL'
            }
        }

        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                bat 'python -m pip install -r requirements.txt'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                bat 'pytest'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                bat 'echo Application deployed successfully'
            }
        }
    }
}

Replace:

YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL

with your actual GitHub repository URL.

For example:

git branch: 'main',
    url: 'https://github.com/username/flask-jenkins-demo.git'

Click:

Save


Part F — Run the Jenkins Pipeline


Open your Jenkins job:

Flask-CI-CD

Click:

Build Now

You will see:

Build #1

Click the build number and select:

Console Output

You should see stages such as:

[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Checkout)

[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Install Dependencies)

[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Test)

1 passed

[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Deploy)

Application deployed successfully

If everything succeeds, Jenkins will show:

Finished: SUCCESS


Part G — Automatic Build When Code Is Pushed


This is the important part of CI/CD integration with Git.

Instead of manually clicking Build Now, Jenkins can automatically start whenever you push code to GitHub.

There are two common methods:


Method 1 — GitHub Webhook


The workflow becomes:

Developer
↓
Changes Code
↓
git push
↓
GitHub
↓
Webhook
↓
Jenkins
↓
Checkout
↓
Install
↓
Test
↓
Deploy


Configure Jenkins

Open:

Jenkins
→ Flask-CI-CD
→ Configure

Find:

Build Triggers

Select:

GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

Save.


Part H — Configure GitHub Webhook


Go to your GitHub repository.

Select:

Settings
→ Webhooks
→ Add webhook

For a Jenkins server that GitHub can reach, enter your Jenkins webhook endpoint:

http://YOUR_JENKINS_SERVER/github-webhook/

Select:

Content type:

application/json

Choose:

Just the push event

Click:

Add webhook


Important

If Jenkins is running only on your computer at:

localhost:8080

GitHub cannot normally send a webhook directly to localhost.

For a classroom practical, you can demonstrate the pipeline with Build Now.

For a real automatic webhook, Jenkins needs to be reachable from GitHub, typically through a properly configured public server/tunnel or hosted Jenkins instance.


Part I — Test Automatic CI/CD


Make a change in app.py.

For example:

@app.route("/hello")
def hello():
    return "Hello from Jenkins!"

Then:

git add .

git commit -m "Added hello endpoint"

git push

GitHub receives the change.

The webhook triggers Jenkins.

Jenkins automatically:

1. Downloads latest code
2. Installs dependencies
3. Runs tests
4. Deploys application

You can see the new build under:

Jenkins → Flask-CI-CD → Build History


What You Need Installed


Software                 Purpose

JDK 17+                  Required by Jenkins
Jenkins                  CI/CD automation
Git                      Version control
Python                   Flask application
VS Code                  Development
GitHub account           Remote repository
Flask                    Backend application
Pytest                   Automated testing

Docker is optional for this basic practical.

You don't need Docker just to demonstrate:

Build → Test → Deploy
