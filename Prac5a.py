Practical 5: Dockerize a Flask Application


Aim

To create a Docker image for a Flask application using a Dockerfile.


Objective

• Create a Flask application.
• Create a requirements.txt file.
• Write a Dockerfile.
• Build a Docker image.
• Verify the Docker image.


Software Requirements

Software              Version

Windows 10/11         Any
Python                3.12+
Docker Desktop        Latest
VS Code                Latest
Flask                  Latest


A. Write a Dockerfile for your Flask/FastAPI application and build a Docker image


Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

1. Open your browser.
2. Visit:

https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

3. Download Docker Desktop for Windows.
4. Install it.
5. Restart your computer if prompted.
6. Open Docker Desktop.
7. Wait until the Docker Engine status shows Running.


Step 2: Verify Docker Installation

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Type:

docker --version

Example Output:

Docker version 28.3.2, build xxxx

Now check:

docker info

If Docker is running, lots of system information will be displayed.


Step 3: Create Project Folder

Open Command Prompt.

mkdir Flask_Project

Go inside the folder:

cd Flask_Project


Step 4: Open the Folder in VS Code

Type:

code .

VS Code opens.


Step 5: Create Flask Application

Create a new file:

app.py

Write the following code:

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Welcome to Dockerized Flask Application"

@app.route("/about")
def about():
    return "Docker Practical"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)


Explanation

Statement                         Purpose

Flask()                           Creates the Flask application

@app.route("/")                   Defines the Home page

@app.route("/about")              Defines another page

host="0.0.0.0"                    Allows Docker to access the application

port=5000                         Flask runs on port 5000


Step 6: Create Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

python -m venv venv

Activate:

Windows

venv\Scripts\activate

You should see:

(venv)

at the beginning of the command prompt.


Step 7: Install Flask

pip install flask

Wait until installation completes.


Step 8: Test the Application

Run:

python app.py

Output:

Running on
http://127.0.0.1:5000

Open browser:

http://localhost:5000

Output:

Welcome to Dockerized Flask Application

Also check:

http://localhost:5000/about

Output:

Docker Practical


Step 9: Create requirements.txt

This file contains all Python packages required by the application.


Method 1 (Recommended)

pip freeze > requirements.txt

Open the file.

It may look like:

blinker==1.9.0
click==8.2.1
Flask==3.1.0
itsdangerous==2.2.0
Jinja2==3.1.6
MarkupSafe==3.0.2
Werkzeug==3.1.3


Method 2

Create:

requirements.txt

Write:

Flask


Method 1: Automatically Create requirements.txt
(Recommended)


Step 1: Open VS Code

Open your Flask project.

Example:

Flask_Project


Step 2: Open the Terminal

Click:

Terminal
↓
New Terminal

You should see something like:

PS C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Flask_Project>


Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment (if you created one)

If your virtual environment is named venv, type:

venv\Scripts\activate

After activation, your prompt will look similar to:

(venv) PS C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Flask_Project>

If you did not create a virtual environment, you can skip this step.


Step 4: Check That Flask Is Installed

Type:

pip list

You should see something like:

Package       Version
------------  -------
Flask         3.1.0
click         8.2.1
Werkzeug      3.1.3
Jinja2        3.1.6

If Flask is not listed, install it:

pip install flask


Step 5: Generate requirements.txt

Type:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

Press Enter.

Nothing will appear on the screen, but the file has been created.


Step 6: Verify the File

In VS Code, you should now see:

Flask_Project
│
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile

Double-click requirements.txt.

It may contain:

blinker==1.9.0
click==8.2.1
Flask==3.1.0
itsdangerous==2.2.0
Jinja2==3.1.6
MarkupSafe==3.0.2
Werkzeug==3.1.3

This is exactly what Docker will use to install the required packages.


Step 10: Create Dockerfile

Create a file named:

Dockerfile

Important:

Do not give it an extension like .txt. The filename must be exactly Dockerfile.

Paste the following:

# Step 1: Use Python base image
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Step 2: Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Step 5: Copy all project files
COPY . .

# Step 6: Open Flask port
EXPOSE 5000

# Step 7: Start the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]


Understanding Each Dockerfile Command


1. FROM

FROM python:3.12-slim

Purpose:

• Downloads the official Python image.
• This becomes the base operating system for your container.


2. WORKDIR

WORKDIR /app

Purpose:

Creates a folder:

/app

inside Docker.

All files are copied here.


3. COPY

COPY requirements.txt .

Purpose:

Copies:

requirements.txt

from your computer into the Docker container.


4. RUN

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

Purpose:

Installs Flask and any other required Python packages inside the Docker image.


5. COPY

COPY . .

Purpose:

Copies your project files (app.py, etc.) into the container.


6. EXPOSE

EXPOSE 5000

Purpose:

Tells Docker that the application listens on port 5000.


7. CMD

CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Purpose:

Specifies the command Docker runs automatically when the container starts.


Step 11: Verify Project Structure

Your folder should look like this:

Flask_Project/
│
├── app.py
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
└── venv/ (optional)


Step 12: Open Terminal

Make sure you are inside:

Flask_Project

Verify by running:

dir

You should see:

app.py
Dockerfile
requirements.txt


Step 13: Build Docker Image

Run:

docker build -t flask-app .

Explanation:

Part                         Meaning

docker                       Docker command

build                        Build an image

-t                           Assign a tag (name)

flask-app                    Name of the image

.                            Current directory contains the Dockerfile


Docker will:

1. Download the Python image (if not already available).
2. Copy your files.
3. Install Flask.
4. Create the Docker image.


Example output:

Successfully built 8b1234567890
Successfully tagged flask-app:latest


Step 14: Verify the Docker Image

Run:

docker images

Example output:

Repository    Tag       Image ID        Size
flask-app     latest    8b1234567890    170 MB

This confirms that the image has been built successfully.


Expected Result

• Docker Desktop is installed and running.
• Flask application works locally.
• requirements.txt is created.
• Dockerfile is created.
• Docker image is successfully built.
• The image appears in the output of docker images.
